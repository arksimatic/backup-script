## About

This is simple python script made for creating copies of files. It was created for my own purpose thus it supports only basic functionalities like copying files, folders and aliases. If you are looking for reliable backup mechanism I strongly suggest using other tools.



## Usage

1. In **backup-script.py** fill **original_path**  and **destination_path** to folders where you store data and where you want your data to be copied.
2. Run **backup-script.py**
